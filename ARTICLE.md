# What I find interesting about it
This article interested me because it reframes the popular narrative of AI’s role in software engineering. Instead of just celebrating AI's ability to crank out code, it calls for deeper responsibility: treating AI output with the same scrutiny and discipline traditionally applied to human-written code. It’s a reminder that technological efficiency must be matched with architectural integrity—especially as AI increasingly shapes how software is built.

I liked the part where it talked about how Ai is helping them remove outdated code, and removing inefficiency.
